    <h4>
        I created a single page MEAN Stack application that shortens urls. It is similar to the URL shortening services like
        <a href="http://goo.gl">goo.gl</a> and <a href="http://bit.ly">bit.ly</a>.As of now it has a really long url as it 
        is hosted on <a href="https://www.heroku.com/">Heroku</a>. The long URL of the site kinda destroys the idea of a URL shortener.
        Nonetheless, it was a very fun beginner project. Check it out at <a href="https://nano-it.herokuapp.com/">https://nano-it.herokuapp.com/</a>.

    <h3>How:</h3>
    <h4>
         This MEAN Stack Single Page Application takes a long url and assigns it a unique ID. Then using that ID, it creates a "short" URL linked to the original long URL.

    <h4>
        I created a very simple MEAN Stack todo application. It has very simple user authentication and it uses a basic Regex to verify email accounts. After you create an 
        account, you go to the profile page, and from there you can go to your todo list. The todo list is very simple, and it includes adding a todo, checking it off if
        it is complete, and a button to clear all the checked off todos. It was a really easy and fun project. Check it out at 
        <a href="https://yash-todo-app.herokuapp.com/">https://yash-todo-app.herokuapp.com/</a>. You can also find its <a href="https://github.com/yash-1337/todo-app">source code</a> on Github.
