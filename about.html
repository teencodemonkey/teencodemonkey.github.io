        I'm a 14 year old who loves computers and programming. That's it, now you know me. Well... actually there's more.
        I got my first computer when I was 6, and I absolutely loved it! I learned more and more and computers  soon became my passion!
        As a result, I have been programming for 3+ years and I am now well-versed in HTML, CSS, Python, C#, C++, and not to forget, 
        my favorite programming language Javascript!I am familiar with many javascript libraries including AngularJs, Jquery, 
        Underscore.js, etc. I am also well versed in Node, including Express. I started blogging about my progress a while back, and 
        I hope to keep programming and blogging as long as I can.
